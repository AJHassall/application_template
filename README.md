Template for an application I am planning

uses Next.JS, ASP.NET 8, Postgres EntityFramework

uses dev containers for the developement environment

to start using this template

install vscode, docker and the dev containers extension

or if you have visual studio installed launch the solutions in that

cd to the ui folder and run npm run build
then in a new terminal cd to the api folder and run dotnet watch/ run
